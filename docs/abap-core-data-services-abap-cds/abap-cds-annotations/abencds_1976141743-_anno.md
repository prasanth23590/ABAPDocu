## Annotation Documentation

The [annotation definition](../../abap-glossary/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.md) documentation ([KTD](../../abap-glossary/abenktd_glosry.md)) is shown below.

## Semantics

Semantic annotations complement the concept of semantic data types, while semantic data types always introduce specific behavior in the provider/core infrastructure (through dedicated operations or conversion functions).

Semantic annotations allow the standardizing of semantics that only have an impact on the consumption side (such as currency code representation together with the amount).

Evaluation Runtime (Engine): Interpreted by the RAP runtime engine (SADL): Translates CDS annotations into the corresponding OData annotations.

## fiscal

No KTD found

## week

### Short Description

A fiscal period is covered by financial reports, for example, an annual report covers a fiscal period of one year, but a quarterly report includes accounting data for three months.

The value of the annotated field encodes a fiscal week as a string following the pattern WW consisting of two digits.

### Example

The string matches the regex pattern 0\[1-9\]\|\[1-4\]\|5\[2-3\]
