## Annotation Documentation

The [annotation definition](../../abap-glossary/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.md) documentation ([KTD](../../abap-glossary/abenktd_glosry.md)) is shown below.

## AnalyticsDetails

To enable Analytics, there has to be defined CDS views which represent the Analytical Provider and CDS view, which represent analytical queries. Analytical queries must select from an Analytical model. Views which belong to the Analytical Provider can be enabled for data extraction. The analytical queries can be consumed by BI-tools like SAP Analytics Cloud, Analysis for Office and others via the Analytical Engine.

Annotations belonging to domain AnalyticsDetails are all on element or parameter level.

## query

This section defines the additional annotations that we need on the level of analytical queries.

## isCell

This annotation specifies that an element should be treated as a cell in an analytical query. This implies that the element, containing either a measure or formula, belongs to neither the measure nor the characteristic structure. It can only be utilized in analytical query views featuring both a measure and a characteristic structure (annotation AnalyticsDetails.query.onCharacteristicStructure). Cells lacking the annotation AnnotationDetails.query.cellReference must be hidden (annotation Consumption.hidden). Formulas should exclusively include operands that are cells. Within cells, formulas support the scalar function GET_CELL_REFERENCE_VALUE, which retrieves the value of a cell within the two-structure grid.
