## Annotation Documentation

The [annotation definition](../../abap-glossary/abencds_anno_definition_glosry.md) documentation ([KTD](../../abap-glossary/abenktd_glosry.md)) is shown below.

## Analytics

Analytics and AnalyticsDetails capture the analytical aspects of a CDS entity. It is relevant if the analytical engine is interpreting the views. Semantically, the “Analytics” annotations can be differentiated between annotations that are relevant for the InfoProvider/CUBE-level and annotations being only relevant for Analytical Queries.

## technicalName

Names in the analytical model are derived from the annotation *`@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName`* for CDS views or from the CDS name for view entities. If a view entity provides the annotation *`@Analytics.technicalName`*, the name in the analytical model is derived from this. It should only be used, when migrating a CDS view to a CDS view entity.
